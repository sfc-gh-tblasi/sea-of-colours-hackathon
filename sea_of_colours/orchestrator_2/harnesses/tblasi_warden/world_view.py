"""tblasi_warden — the WORLD VIEW: a JSON snapshot of everything you can SEE.

Replaces v11's two narrow Section-2 blocks (``VISIBLE RED CELLS`` +
``SYNTHETIC-GREEN``) with a single JSON list of the live board.

Design (option C — "contents only, visibility via DROP-LEGAL"):
  * We list ONLY cells that carry contents (RED / GREEN / BLUE) or a PROBE.
  * Plain empty-but-visible cells are NOT listed — a probe's r4 disk IS its
    visible area, and those disks are already enumerated verbatim in the
    ``DROP-LEGAL ZONES`` block. Re-listing ~80 ``{"c":"none"}`` objects per
    turn would be pure token filler and a second source of truth for "what
    can I see". So the header tells the agent: not-listed = empty-in-view
    (see DROP-LEGAL) OR fog / old vision (still walkable + probe-targetable).
  * ``tier`` drives the RED read; ``val`` (purity) rides along on RED only,
    where the within-tier gradient matters for EV. GREEN / BLUE carry colour
    alone. The only entity that persists between turns is the PROBE, so it is
    the only occupant surfaced here (owner = "mine" or the rival seat label);
    harvesters, EMP detonations and destroyed assets live in LAST NIGHT.

Pure function over the engine ``agent_view``; no state, no persistence.
