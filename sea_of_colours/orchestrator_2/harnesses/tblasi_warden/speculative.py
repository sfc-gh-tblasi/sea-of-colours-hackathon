"""v10 speculative hot-drop picker — vary WHICH bluesign + WHICH drop, per seat.

THE PROBLEM (the user's night-1 observation):
    "the entire board is up, and surely there are multiple equally viable
     bluesigns — per bluesign there are multiple drop points. Why pick the exact
     same thing?" The shared ``top_hot_drop_hints`` flattens every bright cluster
     cell into one list and takes the raw-intensity ARGMAX, so the single
     brightest cell wins for every seat — three harvesters onto one square.

THE PRINCIPLE:
    A bluesign drop is SPECULATIVE (purity is unknown until you land). Among
    clusters of comparable brightness, one is about as good as another, so the
    pick should VARY. Assured red (live LOS / echo-backed) is NOT routed here —
    it stays greedy in the shared chain compiler.

THE MECHANISM (two weighted samples, per-seat rng):
    1. WHICH cluster — sample among clusters weighted by peak brightness, so a
       genuinely brighter cluster is likelier but not guaranteed.
    2. WHICH drop cell — within the chosen cluster, sample a bright cell weighted
       by intensity. Different seats (different rng) land on different cells of
       the same seam instead of stacking the peak.

The probe is launched ON the drop cell (its disk covers the drop for the K+1
landing). Comb SHAPE is left to the agency layer (STRETCH/SWEEP/SAMPLE menu);
these hints carry an empty ``comb_path`` and ``varied=True`` so the geometric
pincer safety-net leaves them alone (they are already per-seat distinct).
