"""tabula_v11 — MEMORY OF LAST NIGHT (Section 3, single elegant block).

This is component (2) of the v11 prompt north star: a concise, scannable memory
of last night that fuses FOUR engine-truth sources into one block —

  * YOU ORDERED     — the exact queue you submitted (engine truth), with the
                      numeric expected yield you committed to at submit time.
  * EXECUTION LOG   — the per-hour timeline of what ACTUALLY happened to your
                      units (drop/step/pickup/probe + ok/FAILED + reason).
  * YIELD           — realized RED/BLUE/GREEN, scored with the ENGINE model, put
                      side-by-side with what you expected.
  * WHAT YOU SAW    — public orbital events + enemy field moves that fell inside
                      your live vision + your losses/denials.
  * REFLECT         — a short, directed reflection anchored to the log above so
                      the agent cannot confabulate a harvest that never happened.

HARNESS-ONLY, NO ENGINE EDITS. The faithful per-hour timeline is NOT on the
agent view (it is stripped from the persisted session blob). Instead we READ the
already-persisted replay frames — one immutable frame per executed/wasted move —
straight from the store via ``store.list_replay_frames(session_id, day, day)``
and reconstruct the observer-filtered log here. Each frame carries ``hour`` /
``owner`` / ``tag`` / ``attempted`` (structured, e.g. ``drop harvester_p1
@(29,16)``) / ``outcome`` / ``caption`` and the per-seat visibility snapshot
``cells_player_{seat}`` (row-major dense percept). The opening frame carries the
submitted ``scheduled_orders`` for the seat.

Visibility contract (RULEBOOK §3.15 / §5.1):
  * your OWN moves          — always shown (with outcome + reason).
  * PUBLIC orbital events   — probe launches / EMP salvos / chaff flares are
                              public, so any seat's are shown.
  * ENEMY field moves       — a rival's step/drop/pickup/mine-lay is shown ONLY
                              when the acted cell was inside YOUR live vision that
                              hour; otherwise it is withheld.

If no frames are available (day 1, or an older session that predates the replay
sidecar) the block degrades gracefully to the ``agent_view.last_night`` channels.
Pure functions over (frames, agent_view, prior_day_entry); the store read is the
only I/O and is isolated in :func:`render`.
