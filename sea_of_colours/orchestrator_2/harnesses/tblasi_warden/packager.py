"""v10 R1 — the DETERMINISTIC packager (compiler back-end).

The thinker (front-end) does the creative work: read state, pick posture, choose
and order tactical options. The resolver expands those IDs to concrete geometry
(:class:`..agency.Option` payloads). This module is the back-end: it COMPILES
that recipe into wire-format moves — a pure function with fully-defined semantics.

Why deterministic (see SEED69_FIXPLAN.md R1): every hallucination in the v9 audit
was in the LLM executor stage — wrong drop cells, multi-drop cycles on one unit,
zero-walk final-night drops, invented cell contents. The executor runs on the
SAME snapshot as the thinker (no new information), so any latitude only subtracts
value. Compiling the recipe in Python makes coordinate faithfulness and the
one-drop-per-unit hold structurally guaranteed, kills a Haiku round-trip, and
removes a whole failure surface. The LLM mover is kept ONLY as the no-recipe
fallback (handled in the harness).

The output still passes through the shared move sanitizer (legality / step
clipping / collision reroute) exactly like the LLM path did — the packager owns
the WHAT & WHERE (from the recipe) and HOW (unit/probe budgeting, contiguous
steps); the sanitizer owns final legality.

    ``selected_options`` is the priority-ordered list of :class:`..agency.Option`
    from ``resolve_plan``. Returns ``(moves, log)``. When ``complete`` is set, the
    utilization pass guarantees every alive harvester and probe is deployed from
    offered geometry. Returns an empty move list when there is no recipe — the
    caller then falls back to the LLM mover.

    ``forbidden_cells`` (Part A1) is the persistent stripped/GREEN union — an
    ENGINE FACT. A step onto one truncates the walk; a drop onto one relocates
    inside the option's own footprint and deletes the run only if no legal cell
    exists there. Since workstream C the menu already withholds such options
    (OBS-22), so this path is a backstop.

    ``avoid_cells`` is the thinker's own soft hint and is kept SEPARATE: it never
    cancels an option the agent explicitly selected — the contradiction is logged
    and the pick wins (OBS-15). Passing it in ``forbidden_cells`` instead is the
    bug that deleted a correct attack and blamed hazard memory for it.

    ``live_red_cells`` (Part A2) is the seat's LIVE-red set — a contested wave's
    sweep may only step onto these cells. ``chaff_short`` (Part C) is the
    thinker's ``chaff_react`` flag; since fix 2.10 it is REPORTED on the card and
    shortens nothing.

    Options are compiled in THE ORDER THE AGENT GAVE THEM. The sole exception is
    ``_order_for_probe_support``, which is legality rather than preference.
