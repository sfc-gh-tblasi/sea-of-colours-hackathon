"""tblasi_warden — OUT-OF-GRID KNOWLEDGE: what you can SENSE but cannot SEE.

WORLD VIEW (the block above this one) is strictly live vision. This block is
the other half of the board model: engine-truth facts the seat holds about
cells it has NO current line of sight on. Two kinds:

  * SIGNS — public beacons over high-tier seams (``redsign`` = pure RED,
    ``blue_sign`` = fissile blue). Visible to every house through fog, but
    deliberately SMEARED: the engine strips the real cells and exposes only a
    fuzzy, off-centre centroid. You know an area, never a square.
  * ECHOES — cells this seat DID see and no longer does (``world.echo`` rows,
    which carry ``last_seen_day``). Exact coordinates, possibly stale content.

The distinction drives the play, so the block states it plainly: a sign must be
PINNED (probe it, then work the disk) while a high-tier echo is already pinned
and can be hot-dropped on the exact cell. That asymmetry is the whole reason an
echoed pure outranks a redsign as a target.

Rendering is conditional per section — a seat with no signs and no rich echoes
gets no block at all, so quiet nights pay no token cost.

Pure function over the engine ``agent_view``; no state, no persistence.
