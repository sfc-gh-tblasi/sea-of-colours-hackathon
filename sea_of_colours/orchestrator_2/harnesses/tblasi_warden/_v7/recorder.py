"""Post-turn recorder for tabula.

After the night resolves, this module:

1. Reads the engine's post-resolve state to determine what the seat banked.
2. Detects probe-crush events (harvester drop cell matched a friendly
   probe's cell at turn start).
3. Updates the current-day memory entry with the outcome fields.

Called by the harness on the NEXT turn's entry (before that turn's LLM
call), so the reflection block is populated when the pilot reads it.
Deferring the write to the next turn means we don't have to reach into
the engine mid-resolve — we just query the session state.
