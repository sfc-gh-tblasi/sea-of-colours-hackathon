"""Deterministic orbit → tactical hand-off compiler.

The orbit phase runs BEFORE each night's planning. During orbit, the
seat can buy weapons, build harvesters, ship parcels, etc. Tabula v3
doesn't yet have an orbit LLM — the orbit stub still submits an empty
action queue — but it now ALSO computes a lightweight ``wishlist`` of
tactical priorities and writes it to memory so the next night's harness
can read and inject them into the prompt.

The wishlist encodes "what the orbit turn wants the night turn to know".
Every entry has a priority (1 = must-act, 2 = should-consider, 3 = nice-
to-have), a tag (canonical name for the priority), and a one-sentence
rationale the agent can quote.

Rules are DETERMINISTIC in v3. Later versions can promote this to an
LLM that reasons about the wishlist itself.

    "beware_emp": "Opponent HAS EMP stock (13-cell blast, 3 missiles per launch). EMP is a vision/landing-denial weapon — see DOCTRINE_BEWARE_EMP for the two mitigation flavors.",
    "beware_chaff": "Opponent HAS chaff stock (cancels your actions for 3 consecutive hours). Avoid predictable pickup windows (hour 6-9, 12-16) and space multi-harvester pickups >=3 hours apart.",
    "beware_snap": "Opponent COULD hold SNAP (100 blue, the cheapest weapon). One cell, resolved before that cell's vision snapshot: a probe there is destroyed BEFORE IT SEES, so a landing that depended on it is refused for want of vision. If the menu offers a PRSNAP* cover, that is a second probe seeing the same cell from a different one — worth considering when a landing rests on a single probe and you would be sorry to lose it, not worth a probe otherwise. SNAP gives no tell, so there is nothing else to plan around.",
