"""Strategist directive — the tiny structured handoff between the v7
two-call split's THINKER (call 1) and MOVER (call 2).

The thinker reasons on the page and FINISHES with one ``DECISION:`` line
containing a small JSON object. We parse ONLY that line, sanitize it, and
render a compact directive block that gets injected into the mover's prompt.
The thinker's reasoning prose is never fed to the mover (see PLAN.md): a
truncated/absent DECISION yields ``None`` and the mover degrades to the
single-call v6 path.

Design constraints:
  * The payload is deliberately tiny (posture + up to 3 targets + a couple of
    flags). Geometry lives in the precomputed hints; the directive only carries
    the *decision*, keeping the handoff seam narrow.
  * Nothing here is authoritative over the engine or the move sanitizer — the
    directive is advisory. Targets are clamped to the grid but a bad one just
    gets dropped; it can never force an illegal move.
