"""Per-(session, player) narrative memory for tabula.

The pilot writes one memory entry per turn. Entries carry:

* ``day`` — the game day this entry describes.
* ``plan_this_turn`` — one-sentence intent, agent-authored.
* ``rationale`` — one line on WHY the plan (agent-authored).
* ``predicted_outcome`` — {"banked_pts_estimate": "high|medium|low",
  "what_could_go_wrong": "one sentence"}.
* ``moves_summary`` — compact string of what was submitted post-validation.
* ``actual_banked`` — filled in by the recorder AFTER the engine resolves
  the night; None until then.
* ``probe_crushes`` — list of "harvester X crushed probe Y at [x,y]"
  strings; populated by the recorder.
* ``memory_note`` — one-sentence agent narrative for future replay.

Storage: ``SOC_AGENT_MEMORY`` (SESSION_ID, SEASON_NAME, PLAYER, KIND,
PAYLOAD, UPDATED_AT). We use ``KIND = 'arena:day<N>'`` as the row key
so each day has one authoritative entry per player; overwrites via
MERGE keep the record idempotent under retries.

Phase 1 keeps this dumb on purpose: no cross-session aggregation, no
strategies index, no vector search. Add those later once the loop is
proven.
