"""Lightweight, mechanical move sanitizer for the tabula_v7 harness.

The prompt does the heavy lifting of getting the LLM to plan good moves,
but three failure modes recur no matter how the doctrine is worded — they
are geometry mistakes the model makes under time pressure, not strategy
mistakes. This module is the structural guardrail that catches them AFTER
the LLM responds and BEFORE the plan is submitted to the engine:

  1. NO-BEACON / ILLEGAL DROP — a ``drop`` onto a cell that is not in
     live vision (no probe disk / friendly-unit tile) or off-grid. The
     engine rejects those, and every step/pickup that depended on the
     landing no-ops, wasting the harvester's whole night. We reroute to a
     legal adjacent cell when one exists, or drop the doomed chain
     entirely. We also refuse a drop onto GREEN / synthetic-green — that
     one the engine ALLOWS (v1.48: this docstring used to claim otherwise,
     which is how the veto came to be applied to steps as well). We block
     it because landing on stripped ground banks nothing and pays -100, so
     it is self-harm with no upside — not because it is illegal. Walking
     ACROSS green is left alone; the menu prices it and the agent decides.

  2. SELF-CRUSH (nuanced) — a ``drop`` onto a friendly probe cell that
     still has >= 2 nights of vision left AND has no loot underneath. That
     needlessly destroys future vision. We reroute the landing to an
     adjacent drop-legal cell to preserve the probe. Crushing is LEFT
     ALONE when it is justified: the probe is expiring (<= 1 night) or the
     cell holds visible RED the harvester needs to grab.

  3. HARVESTER COLLISION — two friendly harvesters routed onto the SAME
     cell collide (both damaged, ZERO parcels banked). We keep the first
     unit's claim and reroute / truncate the second.

Design principles:
  * NEVER emit a move the engine would reject. When in doubt, TRUNCATE
    (bank what's safe) rather than gamble.
  * NEVER strand a harvester on the surface — truncating a chain always
    leaves (or inserts) a pickup so the unit comes home.
  * Be transparent: every change is appended to a human-readable log the
    harness stamps into the audit rationale.

The heavy geometry helpers are shared with :mod:`.validators` so the
sanitizer and the (now-informational) validator agree on drop legality.
