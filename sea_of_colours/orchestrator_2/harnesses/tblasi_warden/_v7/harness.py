"""tabula_v7 — night entry point.

Diff from v4: a doctrine rewrite for comprehension, not new mechanics.
v4's rules/strategies were a single always-on wall of text (and, due
to a copy-paste import, v4 actually shipped v3's verbose probe prose
rather than its own slim mandate). v5 fixes the wiring (fully self-
contained package — every import resolves inside ``tabula_v7``) and
restructures the doctrine around two ideas:

  1. STATE-TRIGGERED strategy. The static prompt carries only a lean,
     always-true CORE (objective + a numbered per-turn procedure +
     the probe mandate + the harvester EV ladder + one canonical
     hot-drop statement). Situational doctrine is appended by
     ``prompt.build_prompt`` ONLY when the live state calls for it:
       * DOCTRINE_BLUE     — setup night OR the orbit wishlist raised
                             ``grab_blue`` (the agent never decides its
                             own blue-need; the orbit bot does).
       * DOCTRINE_REDSIGN  — a redsign broadcast is on the board.
       * DOCTRINE_BEWARE_* — the opponent-weapon tracker flags EMP or
                             chaff stock (unchanged gating from v4).
     A quiet solo night is CORE-only; blue/redsign/weapon text appears
     exactly when it matters, keeping haiku's attention on the plan.

  2. Correct facts. A probe's Euclidean radius-4 disk (~49 cells) is
     BOTH its vision AND its drop-legal zone (cell (x,y) is legal off a
     probe at (cx,cy) iff (x-cx)^2+(y-cy)^2<=16). v4 wrongly advertised
     the 81-cell Chebyshev 9x9 box as drop-legal, so the model dropped on
     box corners the engine rejects, crashing hot-drop chains. The
     DROP-LEGAL block, the hot-drop hints, and the move validator now all
     use the Euclidean disk.

New primary agent SOC_RED_REAPER_TABULA_V7 and finisher
SOC_RED_REAPER_TABULA_V7_FINISHER. v1-v4 remain isolated at their
own bindings.

Flow per turn:

  1. Close prior day's memory (reflect: fill actual_banked + crushes)
  2. Snapshot turn-start state (score, probe cells) for use next turn
  3. Read the last N memory entries → format as replay prose
  4. Build prompt (rules + gated strategies + state + hints + schema)
  5. Invoke Cortex agent SOC_RED_REAPER_TABULA_V7 (single call)
  6. Parse JSON response strictly; on failure, invoke the v5 finisher
  7. Submit the move queue via engine.submit_policy
  8. Write this turn's memory entry (plan + rationale + prediction + moves)
  9. Return an envelope compatible with the orchestrator_2 dispatcher

Only fires on planning phase. Orbit routes to :mod:`.orbit_stub`.
