"""v11 option economics — the numbers behind every menu option.

The v10/v11 OPTION MENU used to render an option as bare coordinates + a probe
cost. The model then had to reconstruct the walk, guess the yield, and cross-
reference a separate DROP-LEGAL block by eye to learn a cell was watched. This
module computes, deterministically, the facts that decision needs so the menu
can carry them inline — making the menu the single source of truth:

  * WALK      — the ordered cells a harvester would drop on + step through.
  * YIELD     — expected score contribution, broken out by colour, using the
                ENGINE's real scoring model (not the harness proxy):
                  RED   score = purity x MULT[tier(purity)]
                  BLUE  scores 0 (it is the fissile spend surface, not standings)
                  GREEN costs GREEN_ENDGAME_PENALTY (-100) per banked parcel
                v1.13 — shipping is automatic and free, so a banked RED parcel
                is worth exactly this. There is no longer a transit charge or a
                catapult row to guess at, so the figure is exact rather than a
                best-case upper bound.
  * CRUSH     — probe centres the maneuver lands on: YOUR probe (bad, lose your
                own vision) vs an ENEMY probe (good, a supersede/denial).
  * COLLISION — how exposed the maneuver is to a rival crash, per the user's
                model: a cell an enemy probe SEES, weighted by how VALUABLE it is
                (mass/pure under enemy vision = a magnet, so HIGH), bumped when a
                rival holds EMP/chaff (timing/weapon risk on the pickup).

Pure functions over ``agent_view`` + an option ``payload``. Reuses the frozen
v7 geometry helpers (``_vision_disk`` / ``_enemy_probe_cells`` / ``_grid_dims``)
so the disk math matches the engine exactly.

#
# MEASURED v1.29, over 28 offline seasons (14 graded / 14 not, same seeds),
# sampling every real smear a seat could see — `scripts/_v12_halo_trace.py`.
# Three things came out of it, and the first is the one that matters:
#
#  1. THIS CONSTANT IS ALMOST NEVER REACHED — 1.0% of priced seams on graded
#     boards, 2.1% ungraded. `blind_estimate` measures each seam it can see
#     and pools across seams first, and that path reads the new terrain by
#     itself. So the terrain change did NOT quietly break redsign pricing.
#
#  2. 55 was never the right number. Real smears measure a median non-pure
#     purity of 30 on UNGRADED boards and 107 on graded ones (n=1095/1525).
#     The original 53/54/63 came from three hand-picked snapshots that were
#     richer than a typical board, so the constant ran ~1.8x HIGH before
#     v1.29 and now runs ~1.9x LOW. It has simply always been off.
#
#  3. The `mass` cliff is not in play. The multiplier steps 1.0 -> 1.5 at
#     151, which is what made an early guess of 180 beat every option on
#     the card (a 6-cell comb prices 281 at purity 55, 602 at 107, 1377 at
#     180). Across 1525 graded samples the measured mean never exceeded
#     **146** — real halos stay in `vein`. A value near 107 is therefore
#     safe in a way 180 never was.
#
# Set from that measurement: 105 is the graded median (107) rounded down, and
# 0.95 sits just under the measured 0.98 — both deliberately a shade
# conservative, since the failure mode this constant has actually produced in
# the past is over-valuing a blind attack, never under-valuing one.
#
# Re-run `scripts/_v12_halo_trace.py` before moving these again, and derive
# from real smears rather than a proxy ring on the pure — the two disagree.
# If the terrain is ever reverted (SOC_MAP_HALO=off) the honest value drops
# back to ~30, though at a 1% reach it is not worth chasing.
_ASSUMED_HALO_PURITY = 105

#
# Exists to answer the question the constant above cannot answer from a
# desk: HOW OFTEN is it actually reached? `blind_estimate` measures the
# board and pools across seams before falling back, so the constant only
# bites when a seam shows no non-pure RED — and whether that is one night
# in three or one in three hundred decides whether it is worth retuning at
# all. Collected over real seasons by `scripts/_v12_halo_trace.py`.

    two thirds or more and made contesting a rival's seam look like a bad bet
    when it was the best play on the board.

    What DOES decay is the halo, not the pure: a seam the finder has worked for
    a night has stripped ground around it. That is priced separately and

    `WALKIN_SECURE` (+1248), `WALKIN_LATE` (+1108), `GRAB1` (+1144) and `CH2`.
    An agent picking two of those reads two four-figure numbers and adds them,
    when the second wave arrives to find the cell already stripped — worth 0,
    and -100 if it steps on the green it became.

    v1.48 (OBS-54) — this used to be restricted to mass/pure RED, on the
    reasoning that "a shared trace changes nothing". True of one cell, false
    of several, and the exception cost a night: on ``duel_s4001_d4_p1``, CH1
    and CH2 ran the same seam from opposite ends and shared three VEIN cells.

    did not, because what a shared cell costs is never just its yield: it is
