"""v11 — SUPERSEDE target selection (blind a rival's probe, RULEBOOK §3.16).

A supersede lands YOUR probe on a rival's live probe: it destroys theirs and
takes the cell (yours survives), denying the enemy that probe's landing + vision.
v7's ``top_supersede_hints`` only fired on the FINAL night and ranked purely by
recency. For redsign combat we want it available every night, targeted with
intent:

* **By owner + score** — when you are TRAILING, blind the LEADER's probes first
  (deny the seat that's beating you). ``hud.scores`` carries every seat's RED
  total, so we can tell who leads and whether we're behind.
* **By recency** — the freshest probe has the most future vision to deny; an old
  probe has already paid most of its value.
* **Skip the near-dead** — a probe about to expire (its vision effectively spent)
  is not worth a whole probe to blind, so it is dropped from the menu.

Harness-only + v11-local: reuses v7's read helpers (friendly probe positions)
without editing shared code. Output shape matches the existing supersede hint so
``agency._supersede_option`` compiles it unchanged, plus enrichment fields
(``owner``, ``owner_score``, ``is_leader``, ``nights_remaining``) for the menu.
