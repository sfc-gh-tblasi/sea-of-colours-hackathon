"""The seat's buying policy — what to spend credits and BLUE on, in orbit.

**This file is yours to change.** It was forked out of the shared
``sea_of_colours.agent.heuristic_agent`` planner in v1.40 for one reason:
a fork could not previously edit how its agent spends money. The planner
lived in a module every seat in the room shares, so "buy weapons earlier"
was not a change any single team could make or push.

Everything below is now local. Two surfaces, deliberately separated:

* :class:`OrbitDials` — the numbers. Thresholds, stockpile caps, the
  fallback prices. Retuning the seat's economy should be an edit here and
  nowhere else, which is what makes it a safe change to hand to a coding
  assistant.
* :func:`plan_orbit_actions` — the priority order. Repair, then fleet,
  then weapons, then probes. Reordering these, or adding a priority, is
  the structural change; the dials are the cheap one.

At the shipped dials this is byte-identical to the shared planner — same
actions, same rationale string — so V12's baseline scores did not move
when it was forked. ``tests/test_orbit_policy.py`` pins that with a
differential test against the shared implementation; if you retune the
dials, that test is *expected* to fail and should be updated or dropped.

Known holes, left deliberately (they are the exercise):

* **Nothing here reads the board.** Buying is a function of credits,
  BLUE and fleet state only. A policy of the form "buy an EMP when a
  redsign is live" needs the night-phase view, which is on ``view`` and
  simply not consulted yet.
* **EMP is capped at a small stockpile** so the seat cannot hoard salvos
  it never fires. That cap is also why V12 buys weapons and leaves them
  in the rack — raising it without teaching the night phase to fire them
  makes the agent worse, not better.
