"""v10 comb shapes — three harvest walks the thinker chooses between.

A hot drop is BLIND: the probe reveals the disk, the harvester drops, but the
whole walk is committed up front. The right walk depends on WHY you dropped, and
that is a tactical judgement — so instead of one canned serpentine, v10 offers
the same drop as a small MENU of comb shapes and lets the thinker pick the
length/area to suit the situation (the user's model):

* STRETCH — a straight-ish line OUTWARD from the drop, allowed to leave the probe
            disk, maximising length / area / fresh intel. Use when the payload
            location is unknown and you want to see and sweep the most ground.
* SWEEP   — a compact serpentine that spends all its steps in a TIGHT area around
            the drop, maximising harvest if you have landed on the cluster.
* SAMPLE  — a quick 2-step in/out. Use on a hot/CONTESTED redsign where you grab
            what you can and lift before a rival collision or chaff zeroes you.

All three respect the engine outing budget: a drop banks its own cell plus up to
5 steps (``HARVESTER_HOLD_CAPACITY`` = 6 cells). Steps avoid known green, never
revisit, and stay on-board; STRETCH may leave the disk (movement needs no
coverage — only the DROP does), SWEEP/SAMPLE hug the disk around the value.

    """A serpentine from ``start`` that walks the value cells it has NOT eaten.

    v12-local replacement for `tabula_v7.probe_hints._comb_path`. Same contract —
    contiguous, never revisits, stays in the probe disk, refuses known green —
    with one correction, and v7/v11 are deliberately left on the old version so
    the frozen champion stays comparable.

    OBS-56, two faults, both visible on the `own_seam_three_pures` turn — three
    pures at (18,2) (19,3) (20,3), and FULL_SWEEP landed on (18,2) and walked
    AWAY, banking one pure of three on the night that decided the game.

    First, the v7 gradient measures each neighbour against the nearest value
    cell *including cells the walk has already banked*, and the drop cell is
    usually the richest on the board. Standing on a pure, all four neighbours
    sit one cell from that same spent pure, the gradient goes flat, and the
    tie-break decides everything. So only UNBANKED cells are scored here.

    Second, that tie-break was "fan out from the probe centre", which on a tie
    walks away from the seam by construction. ``value_cells`` arrives
    richest-first from :func:`enumerate_value_ring`, so its ORDER is a value
    ranking that was being thrown away: ties now go to whichever neighbour
    approaches the more valuable cell, and only then to spread. Without it the
    fixed gradient still chose (18,1) (18,0) — a vein two steps north — over the
    pure two steps east, because both were "one cell from a value cell".
