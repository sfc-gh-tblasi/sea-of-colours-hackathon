"""v10 frontier-probe placement — fuzzy, enemy-aware, edge-seeking exploration.

THE PROBLEM (measured, every seat, every seed):
    The shared probe compiler ranks a placement almost entirely by ``area_gain``
    — how many fog cells the disk reveals — and on an all-fog day-1 board
    ``_seed_candidates`` yields essentially ONE seed: the fog centroid, i.e. the
    map CENTRE. An interior disk reveals the full ~49 cells; an edge disk is
    clipped by the wall and reveals fewer. So the deterministic argmax is always
    the middle, and v1–v9 all open by probing the same central cell — no spread,
    no enemy avoidance, and (in a mirror) three probes stacked on one square.

THE PRINCIPLE (the user's, generalised):
    EXPLORATION is speculative — one open sector is about as good as another, and
    the marginal fog cell in an UNCONTESTED corner is worth more than a duplicate
    cell in the crowded centre. So a frontier probe should be chosen with
    VARIATION, not a single deterministic answer. Assured value (a redsign/echo
    enabler probe) stays deterministic and lives in the shared compiler; this
    module only places the speculative fog-exploration probes.

THE MECHANISM:
    * Generate a RICH candidate set — a coarse grid of disk centres inset one
      probe-radius from every wall, so edge/quadrant placements each still reveal
      a near-full disk (grabbing the sides costs almost no coverage).
    * Score = coverage-BAND (anything revealing ≥70% of the best is treated as
      coverage-equivalent, so a side cell isn't hard-beaten by the centre)
      − enemy-proximity penalty (steer away from ground rivals have worked;
        enemy probe launches are PUBLIC, accumulated season-long in memory)
      − own-history penalty (nomadic doctrine, soft)
      + a light per-seat SECTOR bias (day-1 seats open in different quadrants
        before any enemy data exists).
    * WEIGHTED per-seat sampling (not argmax) with a min-separation between a
      seat's own picks — fuzziness so there is rarely one answer, weighting so a
      genuinely better cell is still likelier, and it always offers something
      while fog remains.

Hermetic: only the v10 harness calls this; v6/v7/v8/v9 are untouched.
