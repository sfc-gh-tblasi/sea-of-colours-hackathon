"""v11 Phase 1 — the VALUE PYRAMID: provenance-tagged value + force-surfaced grabs.

The seed-69 diagnostics showed v10 could SEE a pure and still offer no way to
take it: a LIVE pure not wrapped in a redsign pattern, or an ECHO pure one cell
from live, fell through every precondition-gated menu family and the turn banked
zero. The root cause is that "value" and "how you reach it" were computed
implicitly across five modules with no single, coherent model.

This module makes the top of the pyramid explicit and UNCONDITIONAL:

    IF YOU CAN SEE A PURE IN LIVE — grab it (SMASH).
    IF A PURE IS IN ECHO / on the edge of live AND walkable — walk in and grab it.
    IF the best thing you can see is LIVE MASS — chain it.

...regardless of redsign ownership or whether the seam machinery fired. Provenance
comes straight from the engine view (``red_tiles[].freshness``: ``fresh`` = LIVE,
``stale`` = ECHO) so there is no guessing.

Scope (Phase 1): only value the seat can actually SEE (LIVE + ECHO red, rich
LIVE blue). EXPECTED value (redsign fog, needs a probe to pin the exact cell) is
left to :mod:`.seam_control` (walk-in / probe-grab patterns) and the probe hints.
The grabs produced here are ``chain``-shaped (drop + contiguous walk) so the
existing deterministic packager compiles them with no new machinery.

    is out of live vision AND not walkable from the frontier, the grab builder
    above bails ("needs a probe — leave to seam_control"), and seam_control aims
    its waves at the JITTERED smear centre, which is routinely 2-3 cells off the
    solved cell (the same miss that made agency.py strip redsign HDs). So the
    exact square could go untargeted while OUT-OF-GRID told the agent to hot-drop
    it — an invitation to invent coordinates. This closes it with a real option.

    Dedup is by ``existing_targets`` — cells an offered option ALREADY walks (see
    ``seam_control.planned_harvest_cells``), never by beacon proximity: a redsign
    is minted the first time any seat sees a pure and persists all season, so
    "near a smear" is true of essentially every echo pure and would suppress this
