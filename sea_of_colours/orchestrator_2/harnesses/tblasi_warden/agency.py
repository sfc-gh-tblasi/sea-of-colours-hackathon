"""v10 agency layer — the curated option MENU and the ID -> geometry RESOLVER.

This is the seam that turns "Python decides, agent transcribes" into "Python
CURATES, agent SELECTS, mover PACKAGES". Every tactical choice the harness has
already compiled — redsign seam PATTERNS, hot drops, probe placements, juice
chains, supersedes — is registered under a STABLE, human-legible ID this turn:

    SMASH_GRAB / BLIND_GRAB / UNBEATEN_FLANK / WALK_IN   (seam patterns)
    HD1 HD2 ...   hot drops
    PR1 PR2 ...   probe placements
    CH1 CH2 ...   juice chains
    SS1 SS2 ...   supersedes

Flow:
  1. ``build_registry`` assembles the ID -> :class:`Option` map from the already
     ranked hints + seam patterns (geometry stays deterministic).
  2. ``format_menu_block`` renders the menu for the THINKER prompt — it reasons
     over ownership / players / weapons and returns an ordered ``plan`` of IDs.
  3. ``resolve_plan`` validates the thinker's chosen IDs against the registry
     (unknown IDs are dropped — the menu is the source of truth).
  4. ``format_execute_block`` renders the selected options, in the thinker's
     order, as a verbatim "EXECUTE THESE" recipe for the MOVER to package into
     moves. Low transcription risk: the mover copies pre-built geometry.

The registry MUST be rebuilt identically for the thinker prompt and the resolve
step (same inputs -> same IDs), so the harness builds it once per night.
