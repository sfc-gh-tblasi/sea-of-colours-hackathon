"""Prompt assembly for tabula_v11 — the COMPREHENSION restructure.

v10 keeps v8's three labelled worldview pillars and adds the comprehension
layer proven missing by the v8 audit:

  === SECTION 1 - THE GAME (how it works) ===
    RULES + DOCTRINE (core + state-triggered appendices, now including the
    COMPREHENSION note and the rewritten two-case redsign-poker book) + the
    STRATEGIST DIRECTIVE handoff (mover only, split mode).

  === SECTION 2 - THE BOARD NOW (what you see) ===
    YOUR STATE, WORLD VIEW, DROP-LEGAL, FOG+ECHO, ENEMY PROBES, EMP SCARS
    (new hazard), OPPONENT INTEL, OPPONENT WEAPONS + WEAPON GEOMETRY, wishlist,
    and the precomputed HINT menu.

  === SECTION 3 - WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT (learn) ===
    The two-way WHAT HAPPENED digest (attacks TO you + denials BY you, with
    attribution + consequence — the keystone comprehension fix), the
    collision-aware LAST NIGHT block, the grounded REFLECT block (now forcing a
    consequence acknowledgment for probe/EMP/chaff loss, not just collisions),
    and MEMORY.

Battle-tested block formatters are imported verbatim from ``tabula_v7.prompt``
(pure functions over the agent view); v10 owns the digest-aware blocks and the
sectioned assembler. This is a true fork of the *feeding* layer that reuses
the *computation* layer.

      "WALK_IN"] for CASE 2; add HDn/PRn/CHn/SSn for spare units). The geometry
      is pre-filled — you are choosing and ordering, not inventing coordinates.
      This is the MOST IMPORTANT field: it is what the mover executes. Emit it
      EARLY (right after posture) so it is never lost — an empty "plan" on a
      redsign night means the mover has nothing to execute and will misfire.
  "situational": {"mine": bool, "players": int, "chaff": bool, "emp": bool,
                  "snap": bool}
      — your read of the SITUATIONAL FACTS that justifies the plan. Fill it
      whenever a redsign is live.
  "chaff_react": bool — set TRUE when you EXPECT a chaff/EMP jam tonight (a
      rival with weapons, a scar near your seam, or you are ahead and want to
      lock in). The compiler now HONOURS this: it caps EVERY chain so each
      harvester banks and LIFTS inside the safe window instead of riding a long
      walk into the jam. Use it — it is no longer just advisory.
  "avoid": [[x,y], ...] — up to 3 cells you want kept OUT of tonight's routing
      (a mirror collision point, a cell you believe a rival already stripped).
      This steers cells your picks do NOT already name. It CANNOT cancel an
      option you selected: if you pick a play and also avoid its own drop cell,
      the pick wins and you will be told you contradicted yourself. To not do
      something, leave it out of "plan" — do not pick it and avoid it.
      NOT for the area you are attacking. Listing the contested seam you are
      about to hit is the single most common way a good attack gets mangled.
  "intent": ONE or TWO plain-language sentences — your INTENTION for tonight:
      what you are trying to achieve and WHY (name the seam/goal, e.g. "Race the
      north pure(255) before p2 with a smash-grab, bank short to dodge chaff").
      This is saved to your STRATEGY JOURNAL and shown back to you tomorrow to
      reflect against, so make it concrete and honest — it is your own memory.
  "reflection": ONE or TWO sentences reflecting on LAST NIGHT (read the STRATEGY
      JOURNAL + LAST NIGHT block): did what HAPPENED match the intent you set? If
      not, name the real cause (a FAILED move, a collision, a jam, a misread
      cell) — never call lost cargo "held". Leave empty ONLY on night 1.
