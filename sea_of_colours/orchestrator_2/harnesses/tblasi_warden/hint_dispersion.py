"""v10 Fix A — seat-differentiated, ownership-aware hot-drop dispersion.

THE PROBLEM (measured, seed 42):
    ``probe_hints.top_hot_drop_hints`` is a PURE function of the board, and
    every agent version imports the same module. Given one public REDSIGN
    beacon, all seats compute the byte-identical ``drop_at`` AND the identical
    nearest-first ``alt_drops``. So even when the agent obediently "offsets onto
    the seam", every seat offsets onto the SAME seam cell -> SIMULTANEOUS DROP
    COLLISION -> 0 banked for everyone (observed n-way on the shared beacon, and
    still 2-way on the offset cells night 7 of the 1v1).

    You cannot break a symmetric collision by handing every player the same
    ranked menu in the same order. It needs either per-seat asymmetry or the
    mine/not-mine poker producing genuinely DIFFERENT primary plays.

THE FIX (v10-only, deterministic — NO hidden RNG on the final placement):
    * Attach engine-truth ownership (``mine``) to each redsign hot-drop by
      matching it to the redsign region it targets.
    * MY redsign  -> CASE 1: leave the primary drop on/adjacent the pure. I
      found it, I move first; smash-and-grab is correct.
    * NOT my redsign -> CASE 2: each seat is assigned a DIFFERENT seam offset,
      chosen by rotating the (already deterministic) ``alt_drops`` list by a
      stable index derived from the seat's own id. p1 leads with offset 0, p2
      with offset 1, p3 with offset 2 — so three rivals fan out onto three
      distinct seam cells instead of stacking. The assignment is a stable,
      explainable "approach angle", not a coin flip.

This only rewrites v10's hint payloads in-process; the shared compiler and the
frozen v6/v7/v8 harnesses are untouched.
