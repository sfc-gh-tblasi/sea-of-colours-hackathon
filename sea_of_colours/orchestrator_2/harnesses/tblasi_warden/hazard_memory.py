"""v11 Phase 3 / Part A1 — the PERSISTENT stripped/green hazard memory.

The seed-56 collapse (v11 → 75 pts) was a self-inflicted bleed: the agent
blind-dropped onto a rival's redsign pure that a rival harvester had already
STRIPPED to synthetic green on a prior night. By the time v11 dropped, the cell
was green — but FOGGED to v11 — so nothing at plan time flagged it, and the
engine auto-harvested green for −100/parcel.

The precaution exploits one fact: **green is monotonic.** A cell that has turned
GREEN (harvested → synthetic, or a natural hazard) never becomes valuable again.
So the union of every green cell the seat has EVER seen is a safe, growing "do
not drop/step here" set — even for cells now hidden by fog. This module
accumulates that union per (session, seat) and hands it to the deterministic
packager (which refuses to compile a drop/step onto it) and the move sanitizer
(as a backstop `bad` set that survives fog, unlike the view-only green helpers).

Storage mirrors :mod:`.memory`: a process-local cache always (tests / offline
eval) plus a best-effort ``SOC_AGENT_MEMORY`` row under a dedicated KIND so the
union survives process restarts within a season. A write failure never crashes
the turn.

NOTE: this closes the SELF/observed-green case. A rival stripping a pure while
it is fogged to us is never observed as green — that case is closed structurally
by Part B (do not send a harvester blind onto a fogged rival seam).
