"""tabula_v11 — the continuous STRATEGY JOURNAL.

The agent's night-to-night learning thread. Each turn the agent authors a short
``intent`` (what it is trying to do tonight + why) and, on the next turn, a short
``reflection`` on how that plan actually executed. The harness fuses those with
engine truth so every day becomes a self-contained journal record:

    Day 3 INTENT:  "Race the north pure(255) seam before p2 — SMASH_GRAB wave 1."
          HAPPENED: banked red +206 (5 parcels); 1 FAILED move
          SAW:      p2 launched a probe (12,23); p2 harvester seen (24,21)
          REFLECT:  "Grab worked but I lost a step at H09 (not adjacent); tighten
                     the walk and pick up one hour earlier tonight."

Rendered oldest -> newest so the model reads its own evolving story, then extends
it with tonight's intent. Pure string formatting over the memory entries + the
already-built LAST NIGHT memory dict (see :mod:`last_night`); the only new agent
output is the ``intent`` / ``reflection`` pair, captured from the plan pass JSON.
