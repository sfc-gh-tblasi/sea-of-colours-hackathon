# V12 — the agent you fork

V12 is the LLM agent this distribution ships, and the baseline your
hackathon entry has to beat. It is strong at what it does and has two
deliberate holes. Closing either one is a good day's work; closing both
should win you the room.

**Don't edit this directory.** Fork it:

```bash
python scripts/soc.py new --team redwatch --name reaper \
    --participants "Ada Lovelace, Grace Hopper"
```

That copies these files to `harnesses/redwatch_reaper/`, repoints the
imports, renames the agent identity so your turns show up under your own
name in the audit trail, and writes the `agent.json` that registers it.
Nothing shared is edited. Restart the server and `REDWATCH_REAPER` is in
the New Game dropdown. Keeping V12 pristine
is what lets you answer "is my change actually better?" — you need
something to play against.

---

## The two gaps (this is the exercise)

### Gap 1 — it buys weapons and never fires them

V12 builds EMPs and chaff in orbit, then plays the whole night as if it
were unarmed. The stockpile just grows.

The buying half **is** yours to change (v1.40). It used to delegate to the
shared heuristic, which meant no fork could edit its own economy; the
policy now lives in the fork, with the thresholds hoisted into one
dataclass at the top of the file:

```44:75:sea_of_colours/orchestrator_2/harnesses/tblasi_warden/orbit_policy.py
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class OrbitDials:
    probe_target_stock: int = 4
    blue_always_build: int = 300
    blue_emp_roll: int = 250
    emp_stockpile_cap: int = 2
    # ... prices below are fallbacks; the engine's win
```

Retuning those is the cheapest experiment in the kit — `blue_always_build`
alone decides whether the seat is ever armed before night three. But note
the trap: **buying more weapons without closing the firing half makes the
agent worse**, because BLUE spent on an unused rack is BLUE not spent on
harvesters. The two halves of gap 1 have to move together.

The not-firing is structural. Check where you stand at any point with:

```bash
python scripts/soc.py weapons --agent <yours>
```

It walks four rungs and names the next action. They are ordered because
each is invisible until the one before it works — building doctrine
first changes nothing you can observe.

**Rung 1 — the agent does not know it owns a rack.** The only module in
the whole harness that reads `weapon_stock` is `orbit_policy.py`, the
buying code. `world_view.py` does not carry it and `prompt.py` never
says it. What the prompt *does* render is the opponents' estimated
arsenal, and only when a rival is thought to be armed. So the agent is
told what might be shot at it, and never what is in its own rack. Start
here: it is about twenty lines, and the change is immediately visible on
the card.

**Rungs 2–4** are the four places below that must all agree before a
salvo launches:

1. **The move schema doesn't allow it.** The LLM is physically unable to
   emit a weapon move, because the JSON schema constrains the verb to
   four values:

```43:43:sea_of_colours/orchestrator_2/harnesses/tblasi_warden/_v7/chat_schema.py
        "a": {"type": "string", "enum": ["drop", "step", "pickup", "probe"]},
```

2. **The option menu has no weapon plays.** `agency.build_registry()`
   registers seams, hot drops, probes, chains, supersedes and grabs.
   Nothing offensive. The model picks from this menu, so an absent
   option is an unthinkable move.
3. **The doctrine is defensive-only.** `doctrine.py` tells the agent how
   to *survive* an EMP (`DOCTRINE_BEWARE_EMP`) and how to shorten chains
   when chaffed, never how to use its own.
4. **The packager can't compile one.** Even a hand-written weapon
   selection wouldn't survive `packager.py` → `move_sanitizer.py`.

The engine supports all of it — `RED_HARVEST` (weapons on) fires both,
in `sea_of_colours/agent/heuristic_agent.py` around lines 2250–2410.
That's the reference for what legal weapon moves look like.

**Rough shape of the work:** widen the schema, add weapon options to the
menu, teach the doctrine when firing beats harvesting, extend the
packager and sanitizer to pass the new verbs through. Do them in that
order and you can test after each step.

### Gap 2 — it treats BLUE as an afterthought

BLUE funds the weapons economy, so gap 2 is partly *why* gap 1 stays
unexploited. V12 will grab blue, but only through a narrow gate, and
five separate mechanisms push in the same direction:

| Lever | Where | Current setting |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Purity floor before blue is even offered | `value_pyramid.py` | `_BLUE_GRAB_MIN = 192` |
| Blue must not cost a harvester a strong red chain | `value_pyramid.py` | `_STRONG_CHAIN_RED_MIN = 150` |
| Blue only "requested" when the vault is short **and** ≥2 harvesters live | `prompt.py` | `blue_is_requested()` |
| Blue chain hints suppressed unless requested | `harness.py` | `want_blue` gate |
| Doctrine explicitly ranks blue below red | `doctrine.py` | "RED always outranks blue for a scarce harvester" |

Loosening one lever alone usually does nothing, because another still
gates it. That is the interesting part of the problem.

## How a turn actually works

Read this before changing anything; most "my edit did nothing" reports
are edits to a stage that gets overridden two stages later.

```
run()                                    harness.py:284
  ├─ orbit? → orbit.py (heuristic, no LLM)
  └─ night:
      1. read memory, last night, journal
      2. PRECOMPUTE THE MENU  ← deterministic Python, no LLM
         chain hints · probe hints · hot drops · seam patterns
         · supersedes · frontier · grabs   →  agency.build_registry()
      3. THINK   → prose reasoning about the board        (LLM call)
      4. PLAN    → picks option ids, e.g. ["SMASH_GRAB", "PR2"]  (LLM call)
      5. resolve ids → concrete waves → packager compiles moves
      6. sanitize (fix illegal drops, collisions, self-crush)
      7. submit_policy()
      8. write the card + memory
```

The single most important thing to understand: **the LLM does not invent
moves. It picks ids off a menu that Python built.** If a play isn't in
the menu, no amount of prompt editing will produce it. That is why
"teach V12 to use weapons" is a code change, not a prompt change.

### What a "card" is

`card.py` is not part of the prompt — it is the **debug artifact**. One
human-readable page per turn: the prompt the model saw, the reasoning it
wrote back, and what that compiled to. Turn it on:

```bash
SOC_CARD_DUMP_DIR=/tmp/cards python run_web.py
# then read /tmp/cards/d03_p2.txt after night 3
```

This is the fastest debugging loop you have. When your agent does
something baffling, the card usually shows either a menu that didn't
contain the play you expected, or a plan that named an id the packager
then dropped.

## Where to make changes

| I want to… | Edit | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Add a named multi-wave play | `seam_control.py` | Add a `SeamPattern`; it's picked up automatically |
| Change what counts as worth grabbing | `value_pyramid.py` | The constants at the top |
| Add a new kind of play | `agency.py` `build_registry()` | Plus a builder module for the geometry |
| Change strategy advice | `doctrine.py` | Prose the model reads |
| Change *when* advice appears | `prompt.py` `_assemble_doctrine()` | State-gated |
| Change the output contract | `chat_schema.py` | Then packager + sanitizer must agree |
| Change move compilation | `packager.py` | Ids → concrete moves |
| Change move repair | `_v7/move_sanitizer.py` | Last line before submit |
| Change orbit buying | `orbit.py` | Currently delegates to the heuristic |

### `_v7/` — the substrate

Vendored from the retired `tabula_v7` harness when V12 was made
self-contained. Geometry, validators, hint compilers, the sanitizer.
Prefer changing `tblasi_warden/` proper; touch `_v7/` only for shared
infrastructure, and expect wider blast radius when you do.

---

## Dials you can turn without writing code

| Env var | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TBLASI_WARDEN_SINGLE` | `0` | `1` skips the THINK/PLAN split — one LLM call, faster, dumber |
| `TBLASI_WARDEN_AUTOFILL` | `0` | `1` lets the packager top up a short plan |
| `SOC_CARD_DUMP_DIR` | unset | Write a debug card per turn |

(In your fork these are renamed to your agent — `REDWATCH_REAPER_SINGLE`
and so on — so two teams on one machine don't fight over them.)

Tuning constants worth knowing: `_BLUE_GRAB_MIN` and
`_STRONG_CHAIN_RED_MIN` in `value_pyramid.py`, `_PROBE_FLOOR` in
`orbit.py`, `_MAX_PLAN_IDS` in `_v7/directive.py`.

---

## Testing your fork

```bash
# Scenario suite — fixed boards with assertions:
python -m sea_of_colours.orchestrator_2.evals.cli \
    --config redwatch_reaper --runtime cortex --backend memory

# Head-to-head against the baseline:
python scripts/run_matchup_v12.py --modes lite

# Fast sanity check, no credentials:
pytest sea_of_colours/orchestrator_2/tests -q
```

Your label works as an eval `--config` with no extra setup — the
`agent.json` in your own directory is the only registration there is.

## Known rough edges

Worth knowing before you spend an hour blaming your own change.

- **The finisher fallback is dead.** When the mover returns unparseable
  JSON, `harness.py` tries a "finisher" repair call
  (`CortexAgentInvoker(agent_name=FINISHER_AGENT_NAME)`) before giving
  up. That invoker talks to the Cortex **Agents API** and asks for an
  agent *object* — `SOC_RED_REAPER_TABULA_V7_FINISHER` — which was
  deleted along with the rest of the agent specs when V12 moved to
  Cortex inference over REST. So the repair call fails and the turn
  drops straight to `_heuristic_fallback_decision`. Effect is a worse
  recovery, not a crash. Repairing it (port the call to
  `CortexChatInvoker`) is a legitimate, self-contained hackathon win.
- **Orbit doesn't think.** `orbit.py` delegates to the shared heuristic,
  so the LLM has no say in what gets bought. If your strategy depends on
  buying different things, that is where to start.
- **`_v7` docstrings still say v7.** They describe the vendored
  substrate accurately; only the name is historical.

## Also worth reading

- `manual/agent.html` — one real V12 turn taken apart, percept to moves.
  Start here if the pipeline above felt abstract.
- `ENGINE_INTERFACE.md` (this directory) — the engine boundary a harness
  must respect.
- `../../README.md` — the plug-in contract, if you'd rather write an
  agent from scratch than fork this one.
- `RULEBOOK.md` — canonical rules. If the doctrine text and the RULEBOOK
  disagree, the RULEBOOK is right and the doctrine is a bug.
