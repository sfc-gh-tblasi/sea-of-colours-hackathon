"""Engine MECHANICS the agent must obey (tabula_v11 fork).

Physics does not change between v7/v8 and v10 — the rules are the engine's,
not the agent's. v10 re-exports the frozen ``RULES_SUMMARY`` verbatim so the
fork owns its own ``rules`` module (per the fork convention) without
duplicating immutable text that must stay byte-identical to the engine.

If a genuinely new mechanic ships, add it HERE (and only here); advisory
guidance belongs in :mod:`.doctrine`.
