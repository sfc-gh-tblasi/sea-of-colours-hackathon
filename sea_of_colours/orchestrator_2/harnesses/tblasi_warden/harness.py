"""tblasi_warden — night entry point (clean fork of v11; changes land in Section 2).

v12 starts as a vanilla copy of the frozen v11 champion (identity rebranded only).
The planned v12 work is a Section-2 (THE BOARD NOW) redesign. Everything below is
inherited v11 verbatim.



v11 is the ASSIGNMENT-COMPREHENSION release on the current stack (haiku,
inference API). It inherits v10's whole deterministic compiler stack (faithful
packager, walk-in reachability, the PLAN-vs-CORRECTOR-vs-EXECUTED reflection
digest, seat differentiation, economy/final-night guards) and attacks the
failure class v10's seed-69 diagnostics exposed: the agent has no single coherent
model for "what should each harvester do tonight?" — value provenance
(LIVE/ECHO/EXPECTED) and posture (enemy vision/weapons/tempo) are computed
implicitly and inconsistently across five modules, producing probe-starved dead
turns, echo-pure literalism, and dual-redsign confusion.

What v11 adds vs v10 (see tabula_v11_PLAN.md — the Pyramid × Posture model):
  * Phase 1 — a provenance-tagged VALUE PYRAMID: any LIVE pure force-surfaces a
    grab, any ECHO pure walkable from live force-surfaces a walk-in, best LIVE
    mass a chain — regardless of redsign. Kills dead turns + echo literalism.
  * Phase 2 — orbit ↔ tactics coupling: reserve a probe when reachable value
    needs one; label every play's probe cost.
  * Phase 3 — a POSTURE annotation (enemy vision + droppable-hour, weapons,
    enemy probes, ahead/behind, tempo) that tunes length/timing/defensive riders.
  * Phase 4 — grounded memories: keep v10's self-execution digest + a cross-day
    strategies memory for on-the-job learning.

It owns its turn loop and FEEDING layer (the digest-aware prompt in
:mod:`.prompt`, the doctrine in :mod:`.doctrine`, the option menu in
:mod:`.agency` / :mod:`.seam_control`), while reusing v7's proven COMPUTATION
layer (hint compilers, sanitizer, wishlist, memory, weapon inference, recorder)
by import. v10 stays frozen as the fallback champion. (v12 = native-thinking bet.)

The CONTAINED TWO-CALL SPLIT (reasoning-first thinker -> moves-first mover,
both on the inference API) is native and on by default; ``TBLASI_WARDEN_SINGLE=1``
runs mover-only for an A/B.

Flow per turn mirrors v10: close prior-day memory, snapshot, read memory, build
the v11 prompt, (thinker ->) mover, parse/sanitize, submit, persist, return the
dispatcher envelope (with per-sub-agent audit rows).
