"""v10 Phase 2 — redsign seam-control PATTERN generator.

This is the heart of "agency-first" redsign poker. Instead of the harness
hard-coding ONE offset drop (Fix A) and hoping the agent copies it, we emit a
MENU of named, fully-resolved tactical PATTERNS around each live redsign. Each
pattern is a multi-wave campaign with pre-filled geometry (probe cells, drop
cells, comb walks), an hour cadence, and a "when to pick me" note. The THINKER
selects and orders pattern IDs by reasoning over ownership / players / weapons;
the resolver expands the chosen IDs back to this concrete geometry for the
mover. Geometry stays deterministic (reliable transcription); strategy moves
into the agent (taught by doctrine, not enforced here).

The two cases (from the user's poker book, weapon-free baseline):

  ``H<n>`` throughout means HOUR n of the night, never "harvester n" (R2.7).
  Units are named by ordinal — "the 2nd harvester" — because the two used to
  share a notation and a wave labelled "H2" actually opened at hour 9.

  CASE 1 — the redsign is MINE (I discovered it, engine-truth ``mine=True``):
    * ``SMASH_GRAB``     1st harvester, H01 — belly-flop ON the pure
                         (auto-harvest), pick up fast — the SURE play; I know
                         where the pure is, secure it.
    * ``FULL_SWEEP``     1st harvester, H01 — ALTERNATIVE: ride the WHOLE visible
                         seam in one outing (pures + mass): far more value, but a
                         one-harvester GAMBLE (a mid-walk collision/jam zeroes
                         unlifted cargo; risk rises with more players + later
                         season). The thinker weighs value vs risk vs SMASH_GRAB.
    * ``SECURE_MASS``    2nd harvester, H09 — a SHORT strip of the visible mass
                         ring from the far side (or re-hit the pure under
                         weapons — agent's call).
    * ``LATE_SWEEP``     3rd harvester, H12 — a late, bigger pattern over the
                         dense seam.
    Each is one wave = one harvester, so the thinker composes the fleet (and in
    the DUAL case can send later harvesters at a rival beacon instead).

  CASE 2 — NOT my redsign (a rival found it; ``mine`` False/unknown):
    * ``BLIND_GRAB``     supersede the finder's probe, then a short blind drop
                         with pickup ~H4-5 — imprecise smash-and-grab.
    * ``UNBEATEN_FLANK`` a fresh probe on the OPPOSITE axis to the contested
                         approach, longer chain post-EMP (H8-10) — the secured
                         bank away from the pile-up.
    * ``WALK_IN``        outer mop-up: walk in from slightly outside on a third
                         angle late (H11-16); pure red bleeds into good red.

  CASE 2 also has a PROBE-FREE strand for the rare rival seam that broadcasts
  within a few steps of ground we already light (the drop needs live coverage,
  the steps do not):
    * ``WALK_TO_CONTEST``     short reach, then comb the smear.
    * ``WALK_TO_CONTEST_FAR`` a second unit on a different bearing, spending the
                              hold on the crossing itself.

Cadence is nudged by observed weapons (defensive read only, per plan scope):
chaff seen -> keep a backup wave; EMP scar near the seam -> space the waves past
the cloud window and flank the probe OUTSIDE the blast radius.

Patterns are EXEMPT from the nomadic separation filter (they intentionally
cluster on the seam — that is the whole point of a redsign campaign).

    # wave 1's trail to reach the halo and stripped green the entire way — which

    # this guard. Blocking the wake can make the halo unreachable, so fall back
    # to the pure alone rather than dropping the option entirely.
    # OBS-59. The hedge branch blocked nothing but known green, because only the
    # DESTINATION was ever reasoned about, never the APPROACH. Asked for a route
    # to the pure with wave 1's trail wide open, the pathfinder returns the
    # cheapest one — which IS that trail. On `own_seam_d4` wave 2 re-walked all
    # five of wave 1's cells to reach the pure: about -500 spent on a jackpot
    # the hedge argument prices at a single green.
    #
    # So the wake is blocked MINUS the pure itself: the one cell the hedge is
    # genuinely buying stays reachable, and the walk in has to find its own way.
    # If it cannot, the hedge is NOT re-priced and re-offered — it is withdrawn.

    # restored the -500 route: a hedge whose only approach retraces the wake is
    # not a hedge, it is a 5-cell green tax on a maybe. Break-even is around a
    # 40% chance of wave 1 being jammed, and nothing on these boards is close.

                           WALK across the mass-rich smear, pick up fast.
      * ``UNBEATEN_FLANK`` a SECOND harvester + its own probe combs a DIFFERENT

                           to be contested, so the second unit works its own probe.

    the "ahead / want-certainty" alternative, and — whatever the stock —
    :func:`_walkin_rival_patterns` when the seam is close enough to reach on
