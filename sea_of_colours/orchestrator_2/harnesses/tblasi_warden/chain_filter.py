"""v10 chain-hint post-filter — dedupe by BODY overlap + a minimum-value floor.

The shared v7 :func:`heuristic_chains.top_chain_hints` dedupes candidate chains
only by their START cell, so two chains that begin one cell apart but then walk
the SAME dense seam both survive — the agent then "double-digs" one small
cluster with two harvesters (A8, the seed-69 day-5 wart), wasting a unit. It
also happily offers pure-TRACE chains (peak purity ~3) when nothing better is
around, which the agent mistakes for real red.

This v10-side filter (kept OUT of the shared v7 module so v7/v8 are untouched):
  * VALUE FLOOR — drop chains whose richest cell is below the vein floor
    (trace-only junk). Never strips to empty: if EVERY chain is sub-floor the
    original set is returned so the heuristic safety-net still has something.
  * BODY-OVERLAP DEDUPE — walking richest-first, drop a chain that shares more
    than ``overlap_max`` of its cells with an already-kept (richer) chain.
